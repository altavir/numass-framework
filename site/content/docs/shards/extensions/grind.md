Grind is a thin layer overlay for DataForge framework written in dynamic Java dialect [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/). Groovy is a great language to write fast dynamic scripts with Java interoperability. Also it is used to work with interactive environments like [beaker](http://beakernotebook.com/).

GRIND module contains some basic extensions and operator overloading for DataForge, a DSL for building Meta. Also in separate modules is an interactive console using GroovyShell and some mathematical extensions.
