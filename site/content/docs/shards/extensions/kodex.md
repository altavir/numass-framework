Kotlin is one of the best efforts to make a "better Java". The language is probably not the best way to write a complex architecture like the one used in DataForge, but it definitely should be used in end-user application. KODEX contains some basic DataForge classes extensions as well as operator override for values and metas. It is planned to also include a JavaFX extension library based on the great [tornadofx](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx).
