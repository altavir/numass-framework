An important feature of DataForge framework is ability to work with [meta-data](#meta). 
This documentation is automatically generated by [grain](http://sysgears.com/grain/) 
script from [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and html pieces. 
Such pieces are called shards. The shard consists of data in one of supported formats and meta-data header. 
The ordering of shards is automatically inferred from meta-data by the [script](https://bitbucket.org/Altavir/dataforge-grain).

The meta-data of each shards includes version of this precise shard last update date, 
it's label for reference and ordering information.
