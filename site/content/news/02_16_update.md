The site haven't been update for almost 6 months so it is time for some news.

First of all, the work on project is not stopped. The API's and core concepts are constantly updated. Last few months the main work was concentrated on refining the storage API and on new control architecture.

Second, sadly we failed to obtain a separate funding for the project in 2016, so it still will be developed mostly fro the purposes of "Troitsk nu-mass" experiment and in my free time (of which I sadly do not have much).

The work in near future will be concentrated on finalizing storage and control APIs and the main task is... tasks (the pull data flow model implementation).

The new [DataForge BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/Altavir/dataforge) is separated from "Troitsk nu-mass" code and therefore could be used as a standalone library. There is still quite a lot unsolved issues and a terrible shortage in documentation, but I am working on it.
