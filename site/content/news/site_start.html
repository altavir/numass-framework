			This site is launched. The repository for site development is
			<a href="https://bitbucket.org/Altavir/dataforge-grain">here</a>.
			The site is built using grain framework and uses Bootstrap styles as a template. An interesting feature of
			this site is that while it is static, it is automatically generated from source shards. For example this
			news item is a shard itself
			(see the <a
				href="https://bitbucket.org/Altavir/dataforge-grain/src/8b9d6613962f64d720bff661e5e86b27baafa9fb/content/news/site_start.markdown?at=default">
			source code </a>).
