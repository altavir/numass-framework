			<p>Root is the most used data analysis framework in particle physics. The documentation for this platform is
				extensive and it has good scientific community support. Its main problem is its architecture which
				originates in 1980-s and holds a lot of legacy drawbacks of older FORTRAN platforms. Also the general
				problem is C++. While being very flexible, C++ requires a lot of programming expertise to write safe and
				consistent code. Sadly, physicists seldom are not very good programmers. Nowadays Root hits the roof of
				its
				usability.

				<p>The java analysis studio is quite advanced data visualization framework developed in Standford
					accelerator center. It is modular and has good object oriented design</p>

				<p>It is intended to make an interface to integrate DataForge framework with JAS3 visualization via <a

					DataMelt is huge collection of scientific libraries accompanied by visual framework which allows to
					write analysis scripts in different JVM languages. It is a good memory-safe alternative to Root, but
					sadly it inherits a lot of Root architectural drawbacks as well.
